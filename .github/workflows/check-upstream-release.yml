            A new version of jlesage/docker-firefox has been released: ${{ needs.check-upstream.outputs.latest_tag }}
            The currently tracked version is: ${{ needs.check-upstream.outputs.tracked_version }}

            Please update this Home Assistant add-on to use the new upstream version.

            ## Step 1: Fetch upstream release notes (ALL intermediate releases)

            IMPORTANT: There may be MULTIPLE upstream releases between our tracked version (${{ needs.check-upstream.outputs.tracked_version }}) and the latest (${{ needs.check-upstream.outputs.latest_tag }}).
            You MUST fetch and include release notes for ALL intermediate versions, not just the latest one.

            1. Fetch the list of all releases: https://api.github.com/repos/jlesage/docker-firefox/releases?per_page=20
            2. Parse the JSON array and identify ALL releases that are NEWER than ${{ needs.check-upstream.outputs.tracked_version }} (up to and including ${{ needs.check-upstream.outputs.latest_tag }})
            3. For each intermediate release, extract the "tag_name" and "body" fields
            4. You MUST include the changes from ALL intermediate releases in the changelog entries later, not just the latest one
            5. If a release contains significant Firefox-specific changes (not just baseimage updates), note this for version bumping decisions

            ## Step 2: Check upstream changes for new environment variables

            Fetch and review the upstream README to check for any new environment variables:
            - Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlesage/docker-firefox/master/README.md
            - Look at the "Environment Variables" section
            - Compare with the current environment variables in firefox/DOCS.md and firefox/config.yaml

            ## Step 3: Update files

            1. **firefox/build.yaml**: Update the build_from image tags to use ${{ needs.check-upstream.outputs.latest_tag }}

            2. **firefox/config.yaml**:
               - Bump the addon version following these rules:
                 - PATCH version (e.g., 1.9.0 → 1.9.1): for upstream updates that only contain baseimage changes (jlesage/docker-baseimage-gui)
                 - MINOR version (e.g., 1.9.0 → 1.10.0): when new environment variables are added OR the upstream release contains changes specific to Firefox itself (not just its baseimage)
               - If there are NEW environment variables in upstream that are not yet in the addon, add them to the `schema` and `options` sections following the existing pattern

            3. **firefox/DOCS.md**:
               - If there are NEW environment variables, add them to the Configuration section following the existing table format and descriptions

            4. **firefox/translations/en.yaml** (and other translation files in firefox/translations/):
               - If there are NEW environment variables, add their name and description translations following the existing pattern
               - Check the structure of existing entries and replicate it for new variables

            5. **firefox/CHANGELOG.md**:
               - Add a new entry documenting the upstream update
               - IMPORTANT: Include the changes from ALL intermediate upstream releases you fetched in Step 1 (from ${{ needs.check-upstream.outputs.tracked_version }} to ${{ needs.check-upstream.outputs.latest_tag }}), not just the latest release
               - Format: "Base image update: jlesage/docker-firefox to ${{ needs.check-upstream.outputs.latest_tag }}" followed by the combined upstream changes from all intermediate releases
               - Look at previous changelog entries (e.g., 1.7.0, 1.8.0) to see how upstream changes are formatted
               - If new environment variables were added, mention them in the changelog

            6. **.upstream-version**: Update to ${{ needs.check-upstream.outputs.latest_tag }}

            7. Check **firefox_edge/** folder for similar updates if needed (build.yaml, config.yaml, translations/, DOCS.md, CHANGELOG.md)

            ## Important

            - Look at the git history and existing file formats to follow the same patterns
            - For new environment variables, follow the naming convention and structure used in previous commits
            - Only add environment variables that make sense for Home Assistant users
            - Make sure translations are consistent across all translation files
            - Provide a summary of what was changed, especially if new environment variables were added
